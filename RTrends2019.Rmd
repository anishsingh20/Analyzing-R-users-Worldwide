## Overview

Stackoverflow recently released the anonymized results of their 2019 annual developer survey. The goal of this project is to analyse various trends for R users and developers worldwide.



#### Data Wrangling 

The dataset has 90,000 rows. Our goal is to filter R responses so that we can drill down further and analyze the trends related to R developers.

```{r}

#reading necessary libraries
require(tidyverse)
require(countrycode)
require(highcharter)
require(ggplot2)

#reading the data
data <- read_csv("data/survey_results_public.csv")


#Let's check who all are developers
devTable <- as.data.frame(table(data$MainBranch))


```

Let's create a braplot of the profession of the respondents.

```{r}
